# AutoRenter - Angular 1

An Angular based implementation of the AutoRenter UI.

## Prerequisites

For now, the api must also be running for the UI to work properly. Please follow directions in the corresponding readme.

## How To

**Unless otherwise noted, all terminal commands must be issued from the project's root directory. You must use the Docker Quickstart Terminal if on Windows or Mac.**

### [Re]build and start the containers

```bash
./bin/rebuild-server.sh
```

## Browse the App

After performing a build and executing the run command you should be able to run the application by browsing to `http://192.168.99.100:80/`.
