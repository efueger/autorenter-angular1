# AutoRenter - Angular 1 #

An Angular based implementation of the AutoRenter UI.

## Prerequisites ##

For now, the api must also be running for the UI to work properly. Please follow directions in the corresponding readme.

### [Re]build and start the containers

```bash
./bin/rebuild-server.sh
```

## Browse the App ##

After performing a build and executing the run command you should be able to run the application by browsing to `http://192.168.99.100:80/`.

## Style Guide ##

We will be using the Todd Motto style guide linked below. We are not using ES2015 in this version so anything related to ES2015 in that guide will be ignored. 
We are absolutely using the directory structure and use the new Component Directives when appropriate.
